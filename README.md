Chargeback fraud detection using ML

Chargeback fraud is becoming a more serious problem for many companies, particularly those that carry out business online. Traditional rule based fraud detection systems frequently fall short of keeping up with fraudsters' constantly evolving strategies. We used a real scenario of chargeback fraud at Airbnb for this use case analysis. Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who rent out their homes with those who need a place to stay. When a company bears the full cost of chargebacks rather than shifting the financial risk to their hosts, it is caused by unauthorised users using stolen credit cards to make online payments. Therefore, the credit card company requests a refund from the merchant (Airbnb). As a result, creating a machine learning canvas serves as a necessary step in the fight against financial fraud. In view of this, we begin by giving an overview of the ML canvas, a machine learning project framework that can help ensure successful results. We then go into detail about how we used the canvas for a chargeback fraud detection use case by illustrating various subject areas. The value proposition is the first step, and its primary goal is to offer end users a trustworthy and efficient ML canvas that, in turn, will enable them to identify and stop fraudulent chargeback requests, minimise revenue losses, and maintain a positive business reputation. Inputs like payment platform, currency, payment method, payment country, payment amount, and so on are further defined as part of the ML model's task. Thereby producing a classification result indicating whether the transaction is genuine or fraudulent.
